## 🎯 Project Overview

This project presents a **3D interactive carnival experience**, inspired by traditional Mexican fairs and enriched with **characters and elements from four animated universes**:

- **The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy**  
- **The Amazing World of Gumball**  
- **Phineas and Ferb**  
- **The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker**

The fair includes six fully interactive skill-based mini-games, immersive lighting effects, original textures, ambient and dynamic audio, and animated NPCs. Users will explore the carnival through multiple camera modes, playing as **Link**, and interact with unique rides powered by OpenGL.
